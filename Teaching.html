       The inspiration for going to class to teach each day flows from my core being, and likewise, the little transformations that happen in class have influenced who I am just as much as how I teach. This dynamic between what I am doing and who I am becoming renders my approach supple, but not shapeless. On the contrary, highly structured planning is what allows me to innovate in my lessons and improvise from time to time in class. My students and I both know where we want to go, freeing us to enjoy the process of arriving there. The three stages which comprise my craft are: 1) Structure which at every level relates back to the theme and goals of the course; 2) A polyvalent approach to presentation and practice in class; 3) Perspective and play</p></font>

        “Good fences make good neighbors,” claimed the neighbor in Wendell Berry’s Mending Wall. Likewise, setting goals and defining realistic expectations is the foundation for student success – and for their awareness of their success and the accompanying feeling of satisfaction with good work done. I set goals for my courses which include skills proficiency, knowledge of the subject, critical perspectives, intercultural agility, and, tacitly, personal growth. All lessons, activities, opportunities and evaluations are designed with the course goals in mind. This integration of purpose from top to bottom does the hard work of selection, making the course, to the greatest extent possible, lean, strong, and single-minded, like the athletic feat to which the word also applies.</p>
                 <p align="justify">Grading rubrics help to focus learning, communicate values of the discipline, and track student progress from one repetition of the exercise to the next. Revision is necessary for learning, and often I will ask students to read one another’s writing and to respond to spoken ideas, facilitating students’ learning from one another. I try to maximize opportunities for self-expression, and seek to encourage student responsibility and agency by offering grace periods and choices (between different kinds of oral expression assignments, for instance). A daily dose of culture helps to gain their interest and spark inquiry. I use technology wherever advisable for achieving these goals, too.</p>
                 <p align="justify">My repertoire of technological tools now includes Voki, which allows students to create oral presentations and present them via an avatar; Jing, which allows me to make my own videos in order to give visual and oral feedback on written work or instructions as to how to set up one’s spelling and grammar check for use with the French dictionary; clickers and Polleverywhere.com for encouraging a different kind of student engagement with the material and with one another by making answers to poll questions anonymous and immediately visible; MyFrenchLab is a nice addition to our language classes, and it seems that students come to class better prepared, learn more from the exercises, and feel more satisfied with their work because of it; I used a GoogleDocs poll to collect anonymous mid-semester evaluations from students, increasing their sense of participation in the course and making valuable information quickly available to myself and the other instructors on my team; and I used a Doodle Poll to find a time for an optional “reading group” (office hour outside the office, during which we could discuss the readings) which would suit the greatest number of my students. I also make use of the tools provided in our course management software, such as Forums, the Course Network, Chatrooms, and the online Gradebook which help students to take responsibility for their performance. In short, use of technology helps me to achieve greater in-class and out-of-class integration of my courses, to maintain ongoing intellectual dialogue with my students, and to maximize the opportunities for interaction and for feedback. In a way, these tools have helped me to “flip” my course, although I have not yet intentionally planned it this way.</p></font>

       I enjoy helping students become aware of their own mental processes and their best learning strategies. While it is not possible to teach to each student according to his or her optimal learning style, I vary my methods so as to reach each one optimally at least some of the time. Multiple intelligences theory has provided me with the concepts for understanding different learning styles (including my own) in order to better teach to students endowed with all kinds of intelligences: kinesthetic, visual, logical/abstract, aural, musical, nature, intrapersonal and interpersonal. My presentation often includes tables, flow charts, colors, images, maps, and other realia, for visual and logical learners, but also gestures, performance, dialogues, songs and focus on intonation and rhythm for kinesthetic, aural, and musical learners. I encourage the development of self in relation to the world (natural and human) by cultivating an atmosphere of accountability and cooperation in my classes, as well as genuine interest in the other and concern for the natural world. Small things like providing relevant supplementary vocabulary open up new ways of seeing oneself in relation to others, and new ways of thinking about the natural environment. My favorite question is “Why?” or “What difference does this make?” Through cultural inquiry and the Socratic method, I encourage my students to go a step further in their understanding.</p></font>

     On the level of the individual lesson or activity, I have an eye toward both the spiritual and the mundane. I model for students the ability to think critically, to enjoy challenges and to laugh at oneself. In one class period we may go from the merely whimsical or downright silly to the extremely serious. I employ running jokes and respond authentically to students’ questions and assertions. Sometimes the unexpected becomes part of the lesson, as for example, the day that I tore my favorite pair of jeans on the corner of the desk (my students learned how one responds in French to such a crisis – they had just learned how to console somebody: “Ce n’est pas si grave, voyons !”) or the time when I was teaching indefinite expressions, and went to the door to check if someone was there (this is all part of the act) and lo, there was a student sitting there, just outside the door, and it just so happened that he spoke some French. We greeted each other in French, and the class broke into a hearty uproar of laughter. I suspect that my students will remember both “quelqu’un” (someone) and “ne…personne” (no one) as a result of this happy accident.</p>
           <p align="justify">On the serious side, I engage students in current cultural debates by including French articles and news reports, and videos of various cultural phenomena, including speeches delivered at the Assemblée Nationale, which touch on the current themes of the lessons. Topics include religious tolerance and freedom, values, celebrations, customs, attitudes, and self-expression. These openings onto the larger forum affirm my students in their need and desire to make a difference in the world. They see that I care about informing them and about preparing them in some way for the real world, even if only part of it, albeit my favorite part, speaks French.</p></font>
